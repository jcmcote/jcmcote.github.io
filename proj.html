        Airplane 1998</font></a></h2>
        <p><font face="Arial">In the winter of 98 a few of my
        friends and I were pondering the idea of flying remote
        controlled airplanes in the summer.&nbsp; I found simple
        plan designs on the web and started building my own plane
        without using a kit from the hobby shop.&nbsp; I later
        learned that the wing I had made was for acrobatic
        airplanes and that it would be very difficult to fly for
        a beginner.&nbsp; So I never dared to try and fly it and
        got a pre-built plane from the hobby shop so that I could
        learn how to fly RC planes first. Maybe one day when
        I&#146;m a little better at it I will attempt to fly my
        custom made airplane. Whish me luck!</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Arial">Back in University I had a Software
        Engineering course. Essentially this course was about
        design and implementing our own software project. We
        deceived to make a game of Clue.&nbsp; We had to use a
        CASE tool to assist us in the planning/development. We
        chose Rational Rose since it was about the only tool that
        could generate the C++ code for the class diagrams and
        re-generate without whipping out any implemented methods.
        CASE tools require a lot of discipline to keep up to date
        but it was nice to have a diagram that really reflects
        the actual implementation at the end of the
        project.&nbsp; </font>

        <p><font face="Arial">After the microsouris project and
        two work terms in software I was getting more and more
        interested in software.&nbsp;&nbsp; I especially liked
        the no material required and pure creative aspect of
        it.&nbsp; Object oriented programming was new to me at
        the time and I decided after my C++ University course to
        make a game using OOP technique.&nbsp; At first I was not
        convinced of it's virtues and found that it complicated
        things for nothing.&nbsp; I did not see the advantage of
        data decomposition over procedural decomposition.&nbsp;
        But after many complete rewrites of my game I came to
        appreciate the object paradigm.

        <h2><a name="Microsouris"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Microsouris
        1993</font></a></h2>
        <p><font face="Arial">At the University of Sherbrooke I
        joined an extracurricular project named
        microsouris.&nbsp; Microsouris is a yearly contest held
        in Universities all over the world.&nbsp; A 16x16 cell
        maze is built by the organization committee using 6
        inches tall walls.&nbsp; Students build self reliant
        robots (mouse) capable of detecting the walls of the maze
        and deciding where to go.&nbsp; The goal is to find the
        middle of the maze as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Our
        group consisted of 4 teams: mechanical, sensors, hardware
        and software.&nbsp; I was in the software group.&nbsp;
        The goal for us was to come up with an efficient
        algorithm that would minimize the robots
        displacements.&nbsp; The only input we had was the
        presence or absence on either sides of the
        robot.&nbsp;The best way to understand the algorithm I
        implemented is to imagine the mouse holding a rope that
        it ties to the entrance of the maze. When the mouse
        reaches a dead end it pulls back on the rope to come back
        and marks the cells with an X indicating those cells do
        not lead to the center of the maze.&nbsp; The rope is
        also used to discard entire surfaces. If the rope and
        outer wall enclose a surface that does not contain the
        center cells then it concludes that the enclosed cells
        are not part of the solution and marks them all with X.</font>

        gas.&nbsp;Nowadays plasma balls are readily available you
        might have seen some in hobby shops. Back then I was
        fascinated by them.&nbsp; I bought a book describing how
        to build one.&nbsp; It consisted of a cookie jar and a
        high voltage power supply.&nbsp; The power supply used a
        modified old TV fly-back transformer and 2 power bi-polar
        transistor.&nbsp; It produced 30000 Volts.&nbsp; The
        cookie jar needed to be sealed with epoxy and a valve had
        to be put in on the cap so that air could be sucked out
        and the valve closed after.&nbsp; I asked a science
        teacher at my high school if he could use the school's
        vacuum pump to depressurize my cookie jar.&nbsp; Once
        that was done all that I needed to do was to connect my
        power supply to it.&nbsp; This was one of the most
        interesting projects to play around with.&nbsp; Thanks to
        my 30kV power supply I also made a Jacob&#146;s ladder
        and experimented with other high voltage
        experiments.&nbsp; I did get electrocuted a few
        times.&nbsp; Luckily my power supply did not produce more
        than a few milliamps.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Arial">After seeing some very nice rack
        mount metal cases in the Mark V Electronics Catalog I
        decided I would create a new Timer with a more sober
        front panel.&nbsp; I decided to get rid of the
        clapper.&nbsp; I also put my TV descrambler in the
        box.&nbsp; Instead of controlling only one appliance it
        would be able to control 6.&nbsp; The relays were
        replaced by opto-electric isolators and power SCR
        semi-conductors.&nbsp; This isolated the AC circuitry and
        the digital 5VDC circuits.&nbsp; Instead of the ugly
        silver switches used before the front panel would have
        discrete Schmitt trigger buttons.&nbsp; Schmitt triggers
        are those cool little plates on alarms clocks that detect
        the slightness touch.&nbsp; Pushing them would change the
        state of the outlets from on, off and timed.&nbsp; I also
        added a cable interface because I thought it would be nice
        to have the timer remote controlled.&nbsp; I could build
        a remote control receiver at a latter date and plug it to
        my timer through this simple cable interface.</font> </p>
        <h2><a name="TimerI"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Timer I

        <p><font face="Arial">In the summer of 88 I was visiting
        my mom who lived in Gatineau where the heat and humidity
        is unbearable especially in July and August. We did not
        have air conditioning but I did have a fan in my
        room.&nbsp; I did not want to keep the fan going all
        night because it eventually got cold in the middle of the
        night so I thought it would be nice to make some kind of
        timer to stop the fan after I was asleep and start it
        again before I got up.&nbsp; To do this I used an old
        alarm clock and hooked a driver circuit to the alarm
        signal.&nbsp; The driver would activate a relay an turn
        on the fan.&nbsp; I thought it would also be nice if I
        could turn on/off the fan using a clapper device like the
        one on TV.&nbsp; I put those two projects in a nice black
        metal bock.&nbsp; The front panel had some flashing leds
        and some silver switches.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't
        have any pictures of it.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Arial">In the summer of 88 my friends and
        I wrote a letter to the city of Campbellton New Brunswick
        requesting a skate park for the skateboarders of our town
        but it was turned down so we decided we would build our
        own half pipe ramp.&nbsp; After a few weeks of research
        on how to build a ramp, I drew up a plan for our own
        ramp.&nbsp; We bought 8x4 sheets of 1/4'' plywood and
        some 2x4s and we proceeded to put together our dream ramp
        in my dad&#146;s back yard.&nbsp; The ramp we built was
        8' high and 8' wide.&nbsp; It was pretty big.&nbsp; Since
        we did not have the fancy skateboard gear we would wore
        our hockey helmets, kneepads, elbow pads and hockey
        pants.&nbsp; We were not the most fashionable skaters in
        town but that did not matter because we were not in it
        for the looks anyways. We wanted to get some air, we were
        fixated on rising 8 feet above the ramp like Tony Hawk.
        Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of the finished
        8&#146; ramp.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Arial">Initially I wanted to build a
        racing speedboat but I did not have the special
        water-cooled engine required to build it.&nbsp; So
        wanting to use the airplane engine that I had I designed
        a hovercraft boat except I put the engine in the front of
        the boat.&nbsp; This was necessary since airplane engines
        need the wind produced by propeller to cool them
        off.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <h2><a name="TVDescrambler"><font face="Comic Sans MS">TV
        Descrambler 1987</font></a></h2>
        <p><font face="Arial">At 14 I read an article in Radio
        Electronics magazine.&nbsp; It was about Gated-Synch
        descramblers.&nbsp; The article described how the cable
        company scrambles TV channels.&nbsp; It is accomplished
        by applying 6-db suppression to the video signal's
        horizontal sync pulses thereby making it impossible for a
        TV set to maintain a synchronized picture on the
        screen.&nbsp; The descramblers from the cable company use
        some kind of reference signal that is either multiplexed
        onto the audio carrier or onto some kind of out band
        carrier on an empty channel.&nbsp; Since pirate
        descramblers sold on the black market use this secret
        reference they need to be changed each time the cable
        company decides to change the reference.&nbsp; The
        descrambler in the magazine eliminated the need for this
        hidden reference signal so it did not matter where the
        scrambling system would hide the reference.&nbsp; So I
        decided to try an make this project.&nbsp; The
        descrambler had many adjustments the magazine suggested
        using an oscilloscope to tune it properly.&nbsp; But they
        also had an elaborate explanation for people without an
        oscilloscope.&nbsp; So after many hours of fiddling with
        it I descrambled the First Choice channel for the first
        time.&nbsp; That was pretty gratifying.</font> <font
        face="Arial">Today cable companies use a different
        scrambling technique all together. They adopted a digital
        scrambling technique that are much harder to crack but
        still possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </font></p>

        learning electronics.&nbsp; My first book was Getting
        Started in Electronics by Forrest M. Mines III, from
        Radio Shack.&nbsp; I would not suggest buying anything at
        Radio Shack except for that book. It&#146;s a pretty good
        beginner book.&nbsp; With it I learned all about bread
        boards, relays, resistors, capacitors, transformers,
        diodes, transistors and digital circuits. Of course once
        I started my Electrical Engineering bachelor I realized
        there was a lot I did not know.&nbsp;What is it that they
